### About:  
Spaced repetition is an advanced learning technique that enhances ones learning through an algorithm based upon repetition. The learner is quizzed on a sequence of words and when the learner answers incorrectly, they will see the word within a shorter time period versus if they answer correctly, they will see the word in a longer time period. With the number of Spanish speakers on the rise and halloween right around the corner, Spanish SRS was built with amusement and utility in mind.  

### How to use:  
1. Login or create a username. 
2. Practice words on the 'Dashboard page' by defining and translating, then click the 'Start practicing' link to get started.  
3. Once on the 'Learning Route', the user will be presented with a spanish word and will then need to type in what they believe the translation is. If they guess correct, the user will be congratulated and will gain a point towards 'correct guesses' and the first word will then be pushed further into the list. If they guess incorrect, the user will gain a point towards 'incorrect guesses' and the word will be pushed to the next, next item in the list. This process continues to loop until the user is ready to take a break and log off.  
4. The user's score and correct/incorrect guesses will be saved in the database, so each time they log on they may begin where they left off.
